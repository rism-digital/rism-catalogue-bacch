Cherubini's pedagogical and theoretical works are divided into seven sections, identified by two letters and a sequential number. The first section contains Cherubini's composition course (CO), the second the *Marches d'harmonie* (MH): both works were printed (in 1835 and posthumously around 1847). Cherubini wrote several audition pieces for various instruments or voice (MO) for the annual examinations at the Conservatoire. These are followed by various kinds of exercises, most of which were also written for the examinations: figured basses, *chants donnés*, fugue themes and solfèges.
